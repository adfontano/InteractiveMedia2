        <h2>Form Design</h2>
        <p>Salim Ansari’s Medium article titled “Best practices for form design” covers many important considerations for form design. Nobody enjoys filling out long forms, but designers can build a form that is less mentally draining to fill out. </p>
        <p>The layout must be clean and keep the amount of visual clutter low. Keep each field’s label close by, match the size of the field to the amount of characters you expect, and limit the amount of fields on each page. I particularly liked the suggestion to break long forms up into multiple steps, grouping related questions together. Filling up a progress bar feels far more rewarding than continuously scrolling down a long form.</p>
        <p>Besides the form’s layout it is also important to clearly communicate with the user in places they are likely to notice. For example asterisks are clearly understood to mean a field is required, if a field has formatting requirements they should be listed, and make the active input field clear through visual design. The most important practice that was discussed was clear error messages; error messages should specifically describe what needs to be corrected and highlight the relevant area.</p>
        <p>Form design has many nuances involved that will greatly impact user understanding and retention. In the last year I have noticed that many campus clubs with required applications have designed very understandable and quick forms. It's good to know that there is change for the better out there. </p>
